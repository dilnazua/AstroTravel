# AstroTravel

A Unity & Vuforia-based AR app modeling the Solar System to predict planetary positions and optimize rocket trajectories using PyQt5 & Matplotlib, integrating motors, rocket forms, and launch data via the Global Forecast System (GFS) for enhanced space travel planning.

AstroTravel is an application working both on desktop and Android devices, consisting of a 3D digital model of the Solar system, with the functionality of planetary positions’ prediction over time. Calculations were done using Kepler’s equations and laws. The starting relative positions of planets were taken from the NASA JPL database. The resulting data, consisting of planets’ orbital properties and positions, were saved into a database and used to develop an application on the Unity engine. 
Additionally, AR technology has been integrated into the mobile version of the AstroTravel application. It was done using the Vuforia Unity engine.
Rocket’s flight trajectory prediction program was made on the PyQt platform using the programming language Python and the external library RocketPy. Weather and environment information on the launch site was taken from GFS(Global Forecast System). Newton’s laws and force equations have been used to generate rocket trajectories to later be plotted in a 3D plane using the Matplotlib library.
